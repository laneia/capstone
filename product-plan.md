# Capstone Product Plan - Laneia
The second deliverable for the capstone project.

## Product Plan Components
1. __Personal Learning Goals__: 
-A new programming language (Java)<br/>
-Full-stack development of an Android application and how to use Android SDK.<br/>
-How to build my own database using new software.<br/>
-Integrating share to Twitter and Instagram functionality.<br/>
-Make the app look extremely fly.

1. __Problem Statement__: Life pro tips are best if they come from a diversity of backgrounds and experiences.  This app will enable users to share their wisdom with the world around them, and users can vote if they find a tip helpful or not.

1. __Market Research__: Outline the key insights from your research:
    - Competition:  There are numerous life tip applications, written by an author/team and then pop up as notifications for the user.<br/>
    - Issues in Competition:  The author of the tips unilaterally decides what is good advice with no user input.<br/>
    - Differentiation: This will be a simple way for people to share their tips with one another, instead of receiving a tip written or gathered by the developer.  Users can both send and receive tips and vote on how useful they are.
  
1. __User Personas__: My target users are people who love sharing what they know.  This will range from angsty teenagers who think they are incredibly deep to older users who may actually have some nuggets of wisdom.  Therefore the app is designed for maximum flexibility, in that users can decide what categories of tips they want to receive from, what tips to give, what tips they find helpful versus not, and all in a design that is pleasing to eyes of all ages.
